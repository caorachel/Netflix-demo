In this demo, I used React to implement the following functions
- Show Netflix logo in the navigation bar left 
- Implement ‘My List’ row and 'Recommendation' row with titles and images 
- Display Remove and Add button when hovering over images
- Achieve click button function to remove or add items to ‘My List’ row and "Recommendations" row

The next step

- Manage states using Redux or Hook   
- Improve the effectiveness of the demo
