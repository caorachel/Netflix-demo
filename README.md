# Netflix-demo

This demo is a take-home challenge for Apple contractor position. It contains three components: App, Section, MovieCard respectively. 


In this demo, I used React to implement the following functions
- Show Netflix logo in the navigation bar left 
- Implement ‘My List’ row and 'Recommendation' row with titles and images 
- Display Remove and Add button when hovering over images
- Achieve click button function to remove or add items to ‘My List’ row and "Recommendations" row
- Updated Manage states using Redux  
- Improved the effectiveness of the demo
